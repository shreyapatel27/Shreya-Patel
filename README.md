Force balance in a cable supported structure 
The MATLAB model correctly computes the tensions in cables BA and BC using equilibrium equations. The results show a linear increase in tension with increasing load, with cable BC carrying the major load component. The safety alert and equilibrium check confirm that the system is reliable and the analysis is accurate.
